# Discord Python Bot "Biribiri"
#### Notes
The default prefix for Biribiri is the character `>`, this can be changed with the `prefix` command.\
If you forgot the prefix you set, you can mention Biribiri with the word `prefix`.\
\
`words`: literally the word(s) in the brackets (choices separated by a `,`)\
`{words}`: variable string, describing any word(s) you need\
`{user}`: Mentioning the user, or giving a name in text (using only characters in a-z, A-Z or 0-9)
this second will prompt you to choose an option if multiple are found.\
\
The response message `Hahaha, no.` indicates that you lack the permissions to use the command.\
\
Biribiri is still in development, comments and improvements are welcome (`{prefix}helpserver` or message `Nya#2698` to contact me)

The commands marked with <WIP>have not been added to the rewritten version yet
